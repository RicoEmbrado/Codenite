-> Description

A game made for entertainment modeled after the famous game Fortnite. It is a choose-your-own adventure game where each decision you make alters the ending. The objective of the game is to select the correct decisions so that you can come out victorious with the most health as possible. The game ends when the user dies or if they achieve a Victory Royale. At the end, the user is given a prompt in which they input how well they think they did. It is then compared with a calculated rating to show the difference between how they rated themselves and how the game rated them. The first screen starts with a username input area where the user puts in their name, which then moves onto the actual game itself.

-> How to Play

Input your username in the username text box, then click start to begin the game. After starting the game, read the events and click the button that best represents your decision. On the top left is how many people are left in the game. Your health and shield are shown at the bottom. After you complete a set series of events, you will then be moved onto a screen that shows whether you won or not. At the end, you are able to rate yourself and compare it to a calculated rating that the game chose for you.

-> Interesting Features

1. If you guess your rating correctly, the game will acknowledge that and congratulate you for choosing right.
2. Every death shown underneath the event description are all randomized. They are chosen from a pool of three different death outcomes three times: being shot,        dying from fall damage, or being caught from the storm. The death outcomes may repeat more than once, however the amount of people that died change every time.
